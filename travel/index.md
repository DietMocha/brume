Welcome to my Travels page. This is where I explain where I've been, how I get there, and what I've seen. I'll also be giving a guide for my methods, also linked with my referral codes if you appreciate the tips. I get a lot of the same questions riding an electric unicycle around, so i figured making a page would be easier to send people to.

Please send me any questions you have and I'll be happy to answer them.

If I could travel anyway I want, I'd stick with this for its simplicity alone. What might seem daunting is actually quite fun once you get some practice. and the miles rack up quicker than you'd think. It starts as transport to your local grocery store, and becomes your frugal Citibike. Check out the detailed breakdown I give here, or stop me on the street like hundreds of other have. Feel free to use, or not, my referral code to the distributer I trust. I live in New Jersey btw.

>I started Uberring at the end of college, because I needed a decent paying job that didn't have as many schedule requirements. Well, I found one that has no schedule restraints, and I wish I'd tried it when it started. If your life is busy Uber on the weekends, or once a month. If you need some cash next week, Uber at night. If your friend invites you to a ballgame this Friday, have Linda cancel your appointments and head off. You are your own boss, and the pay is pretty decent (although you should check out city averages on Glassdoor)The only requirement is 1 ride every 2 months (It might be 3), and keep your car insured. It's got a few tax benefits, and comes with backup insurance.
