HAS - Hasbro Stock Prediction
Sep 2015 â€“ Dec 2015
>The project was my first full analysis of a company's direction based on its stock history, rumors, annual reports, and condition. My thoughts on the stock were based off Warren Buffet's tips and 'The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing' by Pat Dorsey. The stock flew over my radar at the beginning of 2014 hovering around $53 a share as I was looking for my first stock to purchase. Instead I chose it as my focus for a senior finance project in the final quarter of 2014 to learn more about stocks before becoming an investor. In December, I gave the stock a buy rating. In the next couple of months the stock rose from $68 to $85 per share. Had I purchased when I planed on it my investment would have grown by 32% within 9 months. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tGvOxl9BEx3RzwxZ0nME9tNVKP1t87SXuClVM7ahqzQ/pub">You can see the project here</a>

Auto Habits
>I have recently started using Microsoft Rewards for Xbox. A system that feeds points back to players who use bing as their search browser once a day. However, I think we can all agree bing has a inferior search browser to google. To save myself from the labor of 'binging?' things daily and weeding though their advertisements. I am building an automated bot that does this for me once I am finished studying at General Assembly. I expect to be using Selenium to simulate a Microsoft Edge environment, web scraping to check my email for its spam mail, AirBnB's Airflow to automate the process to run daily during lunch, Rosetta Code to simulate a computer mouse and search browse the newsfeed, and Neural networks to enter guesses for bing quizzes. This will be a bit of a personal project to test some of the programs and packages I am passionate about while solving a burden.

Image recognition
>My upcoming capstone at General Assembly. In simple terms, I am challenging myself to build a google translate for American Sign Language Images. My script will read images run it though a convolutional neural network

Smart Sims
>Through a window of reports, I led a team of data analysts to build the best business model for market share majority. We dominated the classroom environment and placed third out of eight teams in a class vs. class finals by figuring out some of the best advertising, manufacturing, and product development strategies.
