title: The coders in my family have given me focus
---

I don't know what I'd do without them. I've got 3 smart cousins and an uncle all of them programmers. The suggest either work on getting certifications, go back to school, or work freelance. I've been trying the freelance, but I feel that there may be to many gaps that need filling. I may be teaching my self but that doesn't mean I'm learning everything I need.

I may have landed an internship this summer with Advocate Community Providers. They are a healthcare startup in NYC (the dream) I really hope this holds. I am itching to learn what I need. Although I'll have to switch from Ruby to Python. As that is what they are working in. I'll blog what i figure out, but I think I'll study Codacademy to get the basics before I start.

They say I start in on June 22,

Wish me luck!
