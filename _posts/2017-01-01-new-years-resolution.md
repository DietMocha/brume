title: What do I find so fascinating about Cloud Computing?
---

We've headed full throttle into the internet era. If scifi or videogames have had any forecast on what may come in the past, then we have only just begun.

My fascination with cloud computing is from the accessibility it offers, as tech advances and things continue to become cheaper to produce its availability will only continue strengthen. I like to boil concepts down so I'll tell you why this excites me. If 7 billion people on earth were scientist in a group effort to cure cancer; we would be clocking out at the end of the day with a success. But with computer science this is legitimately what is possible. An entire free barebones education is already available on sites like Khan Academy, while you may not want your degree from there, imagine if people in third world countries were able to attain a basic education for the price of a internet cafe fill with monitors and network In part I've developed a pipe-dream of bringing Cameroon into the technological age.
