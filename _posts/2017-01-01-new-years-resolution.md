Yes it's one of those. But this is how we trick ourselves into moving forward. And whatever the pace or constancy, we move forward always.

To ad a bit of flame under my bottom I've decided to take away the safety net I have made for myself before I get use to it, as its been a year of this field of work now. That's right. I've quit the security gig I was just accepted for good by consistent 12/hr, but I see greater things on my horizon. Because I'm not insane I'll still have a part time job to keep me a float but from what I've read about Uber, that boat only floats you though so much. I know myself. I know I work better under pressure. I've started dabbling in Ruby, Java, and Python to see what fits. Lets see where it leads me.

Good luck me.
