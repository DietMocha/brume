title: Capstone - How do I read the data found?

>I would be lying if I didn't convey how much pressure there is at the end of the course. You can choose to take notes on current material, catchup on past work, finish a group project, or get started on your biggest eye catcher. There are only 3-weeks left and you can't pick them all. Unless your some kinda organized god I suppose, but no one in my class is in a comfortable place on all of them. But that's the point right?

>For me its Capstone > Homework > Group > Lectures. Honestly, the lectures will be there for rewatch, and getting the group pointed in the right direction will help

So I found my beginner dataset to build a model for recognizing ASL
