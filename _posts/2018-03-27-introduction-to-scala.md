Will my words hold true as I dive deeper into Scala in my spare time?

So far Scala is a pleasant new way to express code in a Javascript format. While CamelCasing is my only gripe, using sites like DataBricks to run my programs off machine are some of my favorite parts about cloud computing. I'm also a big advocate of AWS and Cloud9 IDE. After all, my longstanding pipe-dream is to plunge Cameroon into a renaissance of Computer Science to join the rest of us in the age of the internet.
