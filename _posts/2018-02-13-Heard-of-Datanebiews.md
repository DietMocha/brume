Data newbies is a growing blog of gathering noobs, detailing our experience as we are exposed and grow while we enter the data science field. Its purpose is to attract other who may be thinking of taking that big leap and aren't sure how hard its going to be/how to prepare. Also we all just want jobs so the traffic only helps haha.
