title: My Electric Unicycle Compendium
---
**My recommendations**

I ride the GotWay mSuper v3. For those super worried about learning to balance, try the Segway Ninebot One E (not s2 model). If I were to upgrade, and better adapt for NYC, I would buy Inmotion v8. Consider waiting a few months, tho. As my top three companies are coming out with new models. They may be safer, stronger, and cheaper. Gotway has just come out with their latest model the Tesla, Inmotion is coming out with the v10, and Segway is coming out with the NineBot One Z.

**Are you insane?** No.

I basically caught wind of these skimming youtube, and right then and there I was like a dog after a bone.
I just like a challenge, but it's really not as hard as it looks. I didn't know anything about unicycles in 2015, but now I ride amongst the traffic in NYC better then the Citibikes in 2017.

**What keeps you safe?** 乁(ツ)ㄏ Science? Magic? Both?

I would say my safety feels comparable to any bike both in and out of the city. Its a strange dance between greater maneuverability for less stability. Although the only time I really feel like I'm on a unicycle is when I'm going walking pace, its hard to explain but I feel as sturdy as a bike when I'm commuting. Logic tells me I'm not, but of the few crashes I've had they were much better then when I'd crash on a bicycle.

**What's the specs?** *new models go even faster*

It depends on what you're willing to invest initially when your buying. Of the brands I recommend, speeds range from 14-25 miles per hour. While I'm confident in their reported speed. I can only refer to my own cycle for the other stats.  

**Whats the range?** 4 hours, 30 miles max.

While the range is there when you need it. I doubt anyone would enjoy commuting for three and a half hours with any vehicle. Never the less the online stats you read are fairly accurate if your around 160 lbs.
My longest cycle was finding a way from New York Penn Station to Newark Penn Station entirely by bicycle. I went over to the bike path, up to GW bridge, and back down into Jersey City. I started walking my EUC by Rutgers Newark by 6 percent battery. I wouldn't advise going that far. While I'm sure my ankles would get use to it, it would certainly take the joy out of it. Although, I've never felt anything like when I went over that bridge and saw the surrounding cities, breathtaking. If I lived a little closer definitely.

**How fast do you go?** I throttle myself at 22 mph

Is there a danger to going that fast?
While I can't speak for the current generation. I limit myself because I've got an older model from when they first started coming out. The battery has a fail safe if you try going over max speed while on low battery. To protect the battery from overloading the machine is capable of shutting off if you try to push it to hard for to long. Not saying that it will definitely fail, but the chance is unnecessary and I'm not interested in <a href="https://youtu.be/TfKSORDxz2c?t=10m30s">falling</a> at 25 mph. Just no reason. A good rule of thumb for these I've found is ** Don't  be the reason a law is made. ** If you really felt a situation was getting out of your control, don't worry you'll adjust for next time.

**How is this not illegal?**

Funny you should ask that... They aren't laws against them in most places. I suspect it's mostly because of how agile they are, your natural reaction reflexes and how good your sense of balance probably is by the end of that 2 month practicing period. From personal research and experience, they are technically illegal in NYC, but cops neither care or see you as something interesting as long as your not being an asshat. While that's the only case I've heard of, that law was mostly made with hover boards in mind. I don't see it being resolved at any time as any assortment of electricity + bike = illegal as they have worded it, and those are EVERYWHERE. For example Citibike is electric.

**But why tho? like for reals.**

I live down the street from a small town grocery store and a lot of family owned eateries. Running into long lines or not finding the item you want on the shelf makes a 5 minute walk into 30. All for a little dinner. With the Unicycle I'm out and back in within 10 minutes, which is the same as my car in small ranges. As a college student, it sounded like the future and a good way to save money.

**So where do I buy one?**

I spent a long time traversing forums and reading site reviews and all my searching lead me back to <a href="">this guy</a>.
