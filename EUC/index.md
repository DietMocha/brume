title: My Electric Unicycle Compendium

First things first...

**Are you insane?** No.
I just like a challenge, but it's really not as hard as it looks. I didn't know anything about unicycles and now I ride amongst the traffic in NYC better then the Citibikes.

**What keeps you safe?** 乁(ツ)ㄏ Science? Magic? Both?

Nothing more then a normal bike, in fact its the same reason people don't fall over when riding a bike as it rides like one when you're going over 7 mph. I've struck the right kind of balance between sturdiness and adaptability while riding. I made it a 1000 miles before I finally fell off, and that was after two years of riding. Miles broken up into suburbia, off road bike trails, and city riding. All though I will admit riding in NYC seems problematic whether or not it was a regular bike, and honestly I don't feel any less safe. I brake as fast as a bike if not faster, and I can bail easier to avoid something worse. If the road is hazardous, I fit in well with pedestrians as long as I am slow and careful. If worse comes to worse, there's always the option of folding up and pushing it like a roller suitcase (if you get that kind).

**What's the specs?**

It depends on what you're willing to invest initially when your buying. Of the brands I recommend, speeds range from 14-25 miles per hour. While I'm confident in their reported speed. I can only refer to my own cycle for the other stats.  

**Whats the range?** 4 hours, 30 miles max.

This is tough. You don't really grasp the range until you make the trek. I'll tell you that my longest travel was from NYC Penn Station all the way to Rutgers Newark non-stop cycling. Mind you, long range is only possible in warmer weather. That trip felt like 4 hours, which was killer on my feet in the last stretch. Google maps says 3 hours and 30 miles, but 20 mph the whole way was pushing it (I was going max speed at the start for to long). I should say your weight determines the range, and I am a steady 160 lbs. I should mention the scenic view traveling around Hudson and over the GWB. It's an experience I should tell you; especially the bridge.

**How fast do you go?**

Is there a danger to going that fast?
While I can't speak for the current generation. I limit myself because I've got an older model from when they first started coming out. The battery has a fail safe if you try going over max speed while on low battery. To protect the battery from overloading the machine is capable of shutting off if you try to push it to hard for to long. Not saying that it will definitely fail, but the chance is unnecessary and I'm not interested in <a href="https://youtu.be/TfKSORDxz2c?t=10m30s">falling</a> at 25 mph. Just no reason. A good rule of thumb for these I've found is ** Don't  be the reason a law is made. ** If you really felt a situation was getting out of your control, don't worry you'll adjust for next time.

**How is this not illegal?**

Funny you should ask that... They aren't laws against them in most places. I suspect it's mostly because of how agile they are, your natural reaction reflexes and how good your sense of balance probably is by the end of that 2 month practicing period. From personal research and experience, they are technically illegal in NYC, but cops neither care or see you as something interesting as long as your not being an asshat. While that's the only case I've heard of, that law was mostly made with hover boards in mind. I don't see it being resolved at any time as any assortment of electricity + bike = illegal as they have worded it, and those are EVERYWHERE. For example Citibike is electric.

**But why tho? like for reals.**

I live down the street from a small town grocery store and a lot of family owned eateries. Running into long lines or not finding the item you want on the shelf makes a 5 minute walk into 30. All for a little dinner. With the Unicycle I'm out and back in within 10 minutes, which is the same as my car in small ranges. As a college student, it sounded like the future and a good way to save money.

**So where do I buy one?**

I spent a long time traversing forums and reading site reviews and all my searching lead me back to <a href="">this guy</a>.
