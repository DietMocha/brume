    An innovative scientist with a background seeped in communicating with people from other fields and finding new ways to approach problems. I am most at home when I am left to tinker into the night. Seeking an engaging environment with which to further explore the boundaries of machine learning.

  I've always had an interest in a computers. After reflecting on the strength I found and developed during college, I taught myself Python. I decided to fill those other gaps I had from not having a CS background with GA's DSI program. While I found the course challenging to say the least, I pushed though with support from my classmates as we cross the finish line in tandem. I am excited to find new statistical skills, and grateful for direction as I search for a career in machine learning.
